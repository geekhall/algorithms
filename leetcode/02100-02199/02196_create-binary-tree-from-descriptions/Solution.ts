/**
 * ID:    02196
 * Title: Create Binary Tree From Descriptions
 * Difficulty: Medium
 * Description: You are given a 2D integer array descriptions where descriptions[i] = [parent i, child i, isLeft i ] indicates that parent i is the parent of child i in a binary tree of unique values. Furthermore,
 * 
 * If isLeft i == 1, then child i is the left child of parent i.
 * If isLeft i == 0, then child i is the right child of parent i.
 * 
 * Construct the binary tree described by descriptions and return its root.
 * 
 * The test cases will be generated such that the binary tree is valid.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: descriptions = [[20,15,1],[20,17,0],[50,20,1],[50,80,0],[80,19,1]] Output: [50,20,80,15,17,19] Explanation: The root node is the node with value 50 since it has no parent. The resulting binary tree is shown in the diagram.
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: descriptions = [[1,2,1],[2,3,0],[3,4,1]] Output: [1,2,null,null,3,4] Explanation: The root node is the node with value 1 since it has no parent. The resulting binary tree is shown in the diagram.
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 1 <= descriptions.length <= 10 4
 * descriptions[i].length == 3
 * 1 <= parent i, child i <= 10 5
 * 0 <= isLeft i <= 1
 * The binary tree described by descriptions is valid.
