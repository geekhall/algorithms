 * Title: Find Three Consecutive Integers That Sum to a Given Number
 * Difficulty: Medium
 * Description: Given an integer num, return three consecutive integers (as a sorted array) that sum to num. If num cannot be expressed as the sum of three consecutive integers, return an empty array.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: num = 33 Output: [10,11,12] Explanation: 33 can be expressed as 10 + 11 + 12 = 33. 10, 11, 12 are 3 consecutive integers, so we return [10, 11, 12].
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: num = 4 Output: [] Explanation: There is no way to express 4 as the sum of 3 consecutive integers.
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 0 <= num <= 10 15
