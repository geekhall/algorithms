 * Title: Count the Hidden Sequences
 * Difficulty: Medium
 * Description: You are given a 0-indexed array of n integers differences, which describes the differences between each pair of consecutive integers of a hidden sequence of length (n + 1). More formally, call the hidden sequence hidden, then we have that differences[i] = hidden[i + 1] - hidden[i].
 * 
 * You are further given two integers lower and upper that describe the inclusive range of values [lower, upper] that the hidden sequence can contain.
 * 
 * For example, given differences = [1, -3, 4], lower = 1, upper = 6, the hidden sequence is a sequence of length 4 whose elements are in between 1 and 6 (inclusive).
 * 
 * [3, 4, 1, 5] and [4, 5, 2, 6] are possible hidden sequences.
 * [5, 6, 3, 7] is not possible since it contains an element greater than 6.
 * [1, 2, 3, 4] is not possible since the differences are not correct.
 * 
 * Return the number of possible hidden sequences there are. If there are no possible sequences, return 0.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: differences = [1,-3,4], lower = 1, upper = 6 Output: 2 Explanation: The possible hidden sequences are: - [3, 4, 1, 5] - [4, 5, 2, 6] Thus, we return 2.
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: differences = [3,-4,5,1,-2], lower = -4, upper = 5 Output: 4 Explanation: The possible hidden sequences are: - [-3, 0, -4, 1, 2, 0] - [-2, 1, -3, 2, 3, 1] - [-1, 2, -2, 3, 4, 2] - [0, 3, -1, 4, 5, 3] Thus, we return 4.
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * Input: differences = [4,-7,2], lower = 3, upper = 6 Output: 0 Explanation: There are no possible hidden sequences. Thus, we return 0.
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * n == differences.length
 * 1 <= n <= 10 5
 * -10 5 <= differences[i] <= 10 5
 * -10 5 <= lower <= upper <= 10 5
