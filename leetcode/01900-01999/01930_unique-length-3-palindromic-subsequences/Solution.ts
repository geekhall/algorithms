 * Title: Unique Length-3 Palindromic Subsequences
 * Difficulty: Medium
 * Description: Given a string s, return the number of unique palindromes of length three that are a subsequence of s.
 * 
 * Note that even if there are multiple ways to obtain the same subsequence, it is still only counted once.
 * 
 * A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.
 * 
 * A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.
 * 
 * For example, "ace" is a subsequence of " a b c d e".
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: s = "aabca" Output: 3 Explanation: The 3 palindromic subsequences of length 3 are: - "aba" (subsequence of " a a b c a") - "aaa" (subsequence of " aa bc a") - "aca" (subsequence of " a ab ca")
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: s = "adc" Output: 0 Explanation: There are no palindromic subsequences of length 3 in "adc".
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * Input: s = "bbcbaba" Output: 4 Explanation: The 4 palindromic subsequences of length 3 are: - "bbb" (subsequence of " bb c b aba") - "bcb" (subsequence of " b b cb aba") - "bab" (subsequence of " b bcb ab a") - "aba" (subsequence of "bbcb aba")
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 3 <= s.length <= 10 5
 * s consists of only lowercase English letters.
