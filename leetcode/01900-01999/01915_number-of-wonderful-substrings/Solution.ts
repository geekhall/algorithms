 * Title: Number of Wonderful Substrings
 * Difficulty: Medium
 * Description: A wonderful string is a string where at most one letter appears an odd number of times.
 * 
 * For example, "ccjjc" and "abab" are wonderful, but "ab" is not.
 * 
 * Given a string word that consists of the first ten lowercase English letters ('a' through 'j'), return the number of wonderful non-empty substrings in word. If the same substring appears multiple times in word, then count each occurrence separately.
 * 
 * A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: word = "aba" Output: 4 Explanation: The four wonderful substrings are underlined below: - " a ba" -> "a" - "a b a" -> "b" - "ab a" -> "a" - " aba" -> "aba"
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: word = "aabb" Output: 9 Explanation: The nine wonderful substrings are underlined below: - " a abb" -> "a" - " aa bb" -> "aa" - " aab b" -> "aab" - " aabb" -> "aabb" - "a a bb" -> "a" - "a abb" -> "abb" - "aa b b" -> "b" - "aa bb" -> "bb" - "aab b" -> "b"
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * Input: word = "he" Output: 2 Explanation: The two wonderful substrings are underlined below: - " h e" -> "h" - "h e" -> "e"
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 1 <= word.length <= 10 5
 * word consists of lowercase English letters from 'a' to 'j'.
