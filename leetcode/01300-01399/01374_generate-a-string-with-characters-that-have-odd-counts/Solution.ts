 * Title: Generate a String With Characters That Have Odd Counts
 * Difficulty: Easy
 * Description: Given an integer n, return a string with n characters such that each character in such string occurs an odd number of times.
 * 
 * The returned string must contain only lowercase English letters. If there are multiples valid strings, return any of them.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: n = 4 Output:"pppz" Explanation:"pppz" is a valid string since the character 'p' occurs three times and the character 'z' occurs once. Note that there are many other valid strings such as "ohhh" and "love".
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: n = 2 Output:"xy" Explanation:"xy" is a valid string since the characters 'x' and 'y' occur once. Note that there are many other valid strings such as "ag" and "ur".
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * Input: n = 7 Output:"holasss"
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 1 <= n <= 500
