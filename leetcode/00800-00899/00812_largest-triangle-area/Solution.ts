 * Title: Largest Triangle Area
 * Difficulty: Easy
 * Description: Given an array of points on the X-Y plane points where points[i] = [x i, y i ], return the area of the largest triangle that can be formed by any three different points. Answers within 10 -5 of the actual answer will be accepted.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: points = [[0,0],[0,1],[1,0],[0,2],[2,0]] Output: 2.00000 Explanation: The five points are shown in the above figure. The red triangle is the largest.
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: points = [[1,0],[0,0],[0,1]] Output: 0.50000
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 3 <= points.length <= 50
 * -50 <= x i, y i <= 50
 * All the given points are unique.
