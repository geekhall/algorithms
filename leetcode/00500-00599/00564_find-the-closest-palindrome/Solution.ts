 * Title: Find the Closest Palindrome
 * Difficulty: Hard
 * Description: Given a string n representing an integer, return the closest integer (not including itself), which is a palindrome. If there is a tie, return the smaller one.
 * 
 * The closest is defined as the absolute difference minimized between two integers.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: n = "123" Output:"121"
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: n = "1" Output:"0" Explanation: 0 and 2 are the closest palindromes but we return the smallest which is 0.
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 1 <= n.length <= 18
 * n consists of only digits.
 * n does not have leading zeros.
 * n is representing an integer in the range [1, 10 18 - 1].
