 * Title: Interleaving String
 * Difficulty: Medium
 * Description: Given strings s1, s2, and s3, find whether s3 is formed by an interleaving of s1 and s2.
 * 
 * An interleaving of two strings s and t is a configuration where they are divided into non-empty substrings such that:
 * 
 * s = s 1 + s 2 + ... + s n
 * t = t 1 + t 2 + ... + t m
 * |n - m| <= 1
 * The interleaving is s 1 + t 1 + s 2 + t 2 + s 3 + t 3 + ... or t 1 + s 1 + t 2 + s 2 + t 3 + s 3 + ...
 * 
 * Note: a + b is the concatenation of strings a and b.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: s1 = "aabcc", s2 = "dbbca", s3 = "aadbbcbcac" Output: true
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: s1 = "aabcc", s2 = "dbbca", s3 = "aadbbbaccc" Output: false
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * Input: s1 = "", s2 = "", s3 = "" Output: true
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 0 <= s1.length, s2.length <= 100
 * 0 <= s3.length <= 200
 * s1, s2, and s3 consist of lowercase English letters.
 * 
 * Follow up: Could you solve it using only O(s2.length) additional memory space?
