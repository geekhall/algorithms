 * Title: Longer Contiguous Segments of Ones than Zeros
 * Difficulty: Easy
 * Description: Given a binary string s, return true if the longest contiguous segment of 1 ' s is strictly longer than the longest contiguous segment of 0 ' s in s, or return false otherwise.
 * 
 * For example, in s = " 11 01 000 10" the longest continuous segment of 1 s has length 2, and the longest continuous segment of 0 s has length 3.
 * 
 * Note that if there are no 0 's, then the longest continuous segment of 0 's is considered to have a length 0. The same applies if there is no 1 's.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: s = "1101" Output: true Explanation: The longest contiguous segment of 1s has length 2: " 11 01" The longest contiguous segment of 0s has length 1: "11 0 1" The segment of 1s is longer, so return true.
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: s = "111000" Output: false Explanation: The longest contiguous segment of 1s has length 3: " 111 000" The longest contiguous segment of 0s has length 3: "111 000" The segment of 1s is not longer, so return false.
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * Input: s = "110100010" Output: false Explanation: The longest contiguous segment of 1s has length 2: " 11 0100010" The longest contiguous segment of 0s has length 3: "1101 000 10" The segment of 1s is not longer, so return false.
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 1 <= s.length <= 100
 * s[i] is either '0' or '1'.
