 * ID:    02076
 * Title: Process Restricted Friend Requests
 * Difficulty: Hard
 * Description: You are given an integer n indicating the number of people in a network. Each person is labeled from 0 to n - 1.
 * 
 * You are also given a 0-indexed 2D integer array restrictions, where restrictions[i] = [x i, y i ] means that person x i and person y i cannot become friends, either directly or indirectly through other people.
 * 
 * Initially, no one is friends with each other. You are given a list of friend requests as a 0-indexed 2D integer array requests, where requests[j] = [u j, v j ] is a friend request between person u j and person v j.
 * 
 * A friend request is successful if u j and v j can be friends. Each friend request is processed in the given order (i.e., requests[j] occurs before requests[j + 1]), and upon a successful request, u j and v j become direct friends for all future friend requests.
 * 
 * Return a boolean array result, where each result[j] is true if the j th friend request is successful or false if it is not.
 * 
 * Note: If u j and v j are already direct friends, the request is still successful.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: n = 3, restrictions = [[0,1]], requests = [[0,2],[2,1]] Output: [true,false] Explanation: Request 0: Person 0 and person 2 can be friends, so they become direct friends. Request 1: Person 2 and person 1 cannot be friends since person 0 and person 1 would be indirect friends (1--2--0).
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: n = 3, restrictions = [[0,1]], requests = [[1,2],[0,2]] Output: [true,false] Explanation: Request 0: Person 1 and person 2 can be friends, so they become direct friends. Request 1: Person 0 and person 2 cannot be friends since person 0 and person 1 would be indirect friends (0--2--1).
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * Input: n = 5, restrictions = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,3]], requests = [[0,4],[1,2],[3,1],[3,4]] Output: [true,false,true,false] Explanation: Request 0: Person 0 and person 4 can be friends, so they become direct friends. Request 1: Person 1 and person 2 cannot be friends since they are directly restricted. Request 2: Person 3 and person 1 can be friends, so they become direct friends. Request 3: Person 3 and person 4 cannot be friends since person 0 and person 1 would be indirect friends (0--4--3--1).
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 2 <= n <= 1000
 * 0 <= restrictions.length <= 1000
 * restrictions[i].length == 2
 * 0 <= x i, y i <= n - 1
 * x i!= y i
 * 1 <= requests.length <= 1000
 * requests[j].length == 2
 * 0 <= u j, v j <= n - 1
 * u j!= v j
