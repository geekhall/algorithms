 * Title: Regions Cut By Slashes
 * Difficulty: Medium
 * Description: An n x n grid is composed of 1 x 1 squares where each 1 x 1 square consists of a '/', '\', or blank space ' '. These characters divide the square into contiguous regions.
 * 
 * Given the grid grid represented as a string array, return the number of regions.
 * 
 * Note that backslash characters are escaped, so a '\' is represented as '\\'.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: grid = [" /","/ "] Output: 2
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: grid = [" /"," "] Output: 1
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * Input: grid = ["/\\","\\/"] Output: 5 Explanation: Recall that because \ characters are escaped, "\\/" refers to \/, and "/\\" refers to /\.
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * n == grid.length == grid[i].length
 * 1 <= n <= 30
 * grid[i][j] is either '/', '\', or ' '.
