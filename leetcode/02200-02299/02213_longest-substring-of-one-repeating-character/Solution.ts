 * Title: Longest Substring of One Repeating Character
 * Difficulty: Hard
 * Description: You are given a 0-indexed string s. You are also given a 0-indexed string queryCharacters of length k and a 0-indexed array of integer indices queryIndices of length k, both of which are used to describe k queries.
 * 
 * The i th query updates the character in s at index queryIndices[i] to the character queryCharacters[i].
 * 
 * Return an array lengths of length k where lengths[i] is the length of the longest substring of s consisting of only one repeating character after the i th query is performed.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: s = "babacc", queryCharacters = "bcb", queryIndices = [1,3,3] Output: [3,3,4] Explanation: - 1 st query updates s = " b b b acc". The longest substring consisting of one repeating character is "bbb" with length 3. - 2 nd query updates s = "bbb c cc". The longest substring consisting of one repeating character can be "bbb" or "ccc" with length 3. - 3 rd query updates s = " bbb b cc". The longest substring consisting of one repeating character is "bbbb" with length 4. Thus, we return [3,3,4].
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: s = "abyzz", queryCharacters = "aa", queryIndices = [2,1] Output: [2,3] Explanation: - 1 st query updates s = "ab a zz". The longest substring consisting of one repeating character is "zz" with length 2. - 2 nd query updates s = " a a a zz". The longest substring consisting of one repeating character is "aaa" with length 3. Thus, we return [2,3].
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 1 <= s.length <= 10 5
 * s consists of lowercase English letters.
 * k == queryCharacters.length == queryIndices.length
 * 1 <= k <= 10 5
 * queryCharacters consists of lowercase English letters.
 * 0 <= queryIndices[i] < s.length
